# Introduction

MudForge plugins extend the functionality of the MUD client using Lua scripting.

## What Can Plugins Do?

- **Create Custom Widgets** - Canvas for graphics, HTML for rich content, text for simple display
- **Draw Graphics** - Shapes, text, images with full canvas API
- **React to MUD Output** - Triggers match patterns in MUD text
- **Create Shortcuts** - Aliases transform commands before sending
- **Schedule Actions** - Timers run code periodically or after delays
- **Store Data** - Variables and tables persist across sessions
- **Access Protocols** - GMCP and MSDP data from the MUD server
- **Multi-Session** - Communicate between multiple MUD connections

## Engine Types

MudForge supports two plugin engine types:

### Next-Gen Engine (Recommended)

```lua
settings = {
  engineType = "next-gen"
}
```

The Next-Gen engine provides a cleaner API:
- Drawing functions don't require widget ID as first parameter
- Uses `setActiveWidget()` to target a widget for drawing
- Better performance

### Legacy Engine

```lua
settings = {
  engineType = "legacy"  -- or omit
}
```

The Legacy engine maintains compatibility with older plugins:
- Widget ID is first parameter in drawing functions
- MUSHclient-style API
