## Custom Capture Patterns

Capture specific text and route it to tabs with custom colors.

### Creating a Capture

1. Open Settings → Captures
2. Enter a pattern (regex by default)
3. Optionally set a color
4. Optionally select a destination tab
5. Click "Add Capture"

### Example Patterns

| Purpose | Pattern |
|---------|---------|
| Capture tells | `tells you` |
| Combat damage | `You .* for \d+ damage` |
| Loot messages | `You (get\|receive\|find)` |
| Level up | `gained a level` |

### Tips

- Use regex for flexible matching
- Disable "Is Regex" for simple text matching
- Set a bright color for important messages
- Route combat to a dedicated "Combat" tab
